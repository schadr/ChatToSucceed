Organizations must manage knowledge in all stages of software development efforts\?from encapsulating design requirements to creating and testing programs, installation, and maintenance. Knowledge even extends to the improvement of organizational software development processes and practices. This article examines knowledge management practices in more than 50 software organizations over the last three years, describing the major findings in the context of knowledge management in software development efforts on a global scale.This article is part of a special issue on Global Software Development.},
