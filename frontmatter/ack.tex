\textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my family for their constant support and for encouraging me to follow my academic path which began in Saarbr{\"u}ken, Germany and lead me to Victoria, Canada.
%
Not only was I given the opportunity to work with a top notch research group which was headed by my mentor, Daniela Damian, but I also found Jennifer, the love of my life. She not only sustained me throughout my time as a PhD student, but also helped me to make sense of a whole new world.

Furthermore, I owe a great deal of gratitude to my academic advisors and mentors from my previous University, specifically Thomas Zimmermann and Andreas Zeller, for they opened my mind to the field of empirical software engineering.
%
Of course, a huge thanks goes out to the many friends I've made during my time in Victoria. Especially those in the SEGaL group with Sabrina and Irwin who always had much needed advice, and Thanh with his easy going style, showing me that just about everything has an upside.
Not to forget, the new generation of SEGaLs: Indira, German, Arber, Eirini, Eric, Alessia, and Jorge who kept me going until the very end.
