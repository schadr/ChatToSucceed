Acknowledgements
\end{center}

First and foremost I would like to thank my family who supported and enabled me to follow my academic path that began in Saarbr{\"u}cken Germany far away from home and lead me to Victoria, Canada, believe it or not even farther away.
%
Not only did I find the chance to work with a top notch research group headed by my mentor and friend Daniela Damian but I also found the love of my life Jennifer who not only sustained me throughout my time as a PhD student but also helped me to make sense of a new world.

I also owe a great deal of gratitude to my academic advisors and mentors from my previous university, especially Thomas Zimmermann and Andreas Zeller, for opening up my mind to the field of empirical software engineering.
%
And of course the many friends I made in Victoria, especially in the SEGaL group with Sabrina and Irwin who were there with much needed advice and Thanh with his easygoing style showing me that about anything has an upside.
Not to forget the new generation of SEGaLs, Indira, German, Arber, Eirini, Eric, Alessia, and Jorge who kept me going until the very end.
